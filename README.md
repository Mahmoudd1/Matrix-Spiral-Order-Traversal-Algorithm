# Matrix-Spiral-Order-Traversal-Algorithm
This is a Java implementation of the Matrix Spiral Order Traversal Algorithm, which is used to traverse a matrix in a spiral order, starting from the top-left corner and moving clockwise.
## Sample Input and Output for Matrix Spiral Order Traversal
Given an m x n matrix return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12]]

Output: [1,2,3,4,8,12,11,10,9,5,6,7]

## Algorithm Description
This implementation uses a four-directional approach to traverse the matrix in a spiral order. We start by defining four variables to keep track of the boundaries of the matrix: left, right, up, and down. We then use a while loop to traverse the matrix in a spiral order, adding each element to a List<Integer> called mylist
 In each iteration of the loop, we use four for loops to traverse the matrix in four directions:
- Traverse from left to right on the top row (up).
- Traverse from top to bottom on the right column (right).
- Traverse from right to left on the bottom row (down).
- Traverse from bottom to top on the left column (left)
  After each direction is traversed, we update the boundaries of the matrix and continue the loop until all elements have been added to mylist.
## Complexity Analysis
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we need to visit each element in the matrix exactly once.

The space complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n), since we are storing all elements of the matrix in a List<Integer>.
